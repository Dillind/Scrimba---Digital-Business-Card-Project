# SCRIMBA REACTJS COURSE:

## Project 1: Digital Business Card

I have completed the scrimba project that asked me to develop a digital business card similar to the figma file.

It was interesting enough to create the card and play around with the css and react components. Overall, I really enjoyed the project and am looking forward to the rest!

Improvements:

- Look to upload the file to github before you complete it and make consistent commits to the file.
